#Portscanner:
The practice of attempting to connect to a range of ports in sequence on a single host is commonly known as port scanning.
This is usually associated either with malicious cracking attempts or with network administrators looking for possible vulnerabilities to help prevent such attacks. Port connection attempts are frequently monitored and logged by hosts.
The technique of port knocking uses a series of port connections (knocks) from a client computer to enable a server connection.
